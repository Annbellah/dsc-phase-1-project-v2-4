## Business Problem
Microsoft is venturing into original video content creation by establishing a new movie studio. Given their lack of experience in this industry, the objective is to make decisions regarding the types of films to produce. To accomplish this, I will gather and process data from various movie datasets, translating the results into actionable insights for the head of Microsoft's new movie studio.
